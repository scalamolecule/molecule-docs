> Prioritize program reasoning over technical limitations.

> Prioritize process flexibility over technical limitations.

> Being able to reason about a program should have priority over technical limitations.

> Being able to modify a process should have priority over technical limitations.

> Object(Class)-oriented programming splinters the domain and kills program reasoning
