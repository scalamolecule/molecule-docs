# Molecule code

On the following pages, we'll walk through how you can code and express your domain with Molecule. 

Maybe you want to follow along in code too:

### Quick start demo

The fastest way to build some molecules yourself is to clone the [molecule-demo](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-demo) github repo and play around with the code in your IDE:

```
git clone https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-demo.git
cd molecule-demo
sbt compile

// open in your IDE
// build more molecules in the App test
// Add some of your own attributes to the schema

sbt compile

// build some molecules with your own attributes!
```

### Setup Molecule in your own project

[Setup Molecule](/setup/) in your own project and model your own domain with Molecule.


### Study example/core tests

When you have acquired some experience with Molecule you can clone the Molecule repo and dive into the extensive example/core tests. This is where the rubber hits the road and the widest range of capabilities are tested. You can then apply some of the techniques to your own code.

```
git clone https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule.git
// open in IDE and explore the tests
```
