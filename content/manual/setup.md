# Setup

To use Molecule we need to define our database schema in a [Schema definition](/manual/schema) file and then tell
sbt about it. When compiling our project from the command line, all necessary boilerplate code is 
then automatically generated by the [sbt MoleculePlugin](https://github.com/scalamolecule/sbt-molecule).

## 1. SBT build settings

Add the following to your build files: 

`project/build.properties`:

```scala
sbt.version=1.1.6
```

`project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.scalamolecule" % "sbt-molecule" % "0.7.2")
```

`build.sbt`:

```scala
lazy val yourProject = project.in(file("app"))
  .enablePlugins(MoleculePlugin)
  .settings(
    resolvers ++= Seq(
      "datomic" at "http://files.datomic.com/maven",
      "clojars" at "http://clojars.org/repo",
      Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases")
    ),
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "org.scalamolecule" %% "molecule" % "0.17.2",
      "com.datomic" % "datomic-free" % "0.9.5697"
    ),
    moleculeSchemas := Seq("app") // paths to directory with your schema definition file(s)
  )
```
Molecule 0.17.2 for Scala 2.12.8 is available at
[Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/scalamolecule/molecule_2.12/).


## 2. Paths to Schema definition files

We use the `moleculeSchemas` sbt settings key to tell the sbt MoleculePlugin where we have our Schema definition files.

A [Schema definition](/manual/schema) file contains a plain Scala object where you define
partitions/namespaces/attributes of your Datomic database. The MoleculePlugin uses the information
defined there to create all the boilerplate code needed to use Molecule in your code.

You can have a single or several Schema definition files in a project. Each definition file defines a single database. 
This is useful if you for instance want to experiment with various database designs during development.

Schema definiton files should reside in directories named `schema` anywhere in your source code.

Use the `moleculeSchemas` sbt settings key to list the directories in your project source
code that contains your `schema` directories.

Say you have a project `app` and a single Schema definition file `YourDomainDefinition.scala`
defining your database:

![](/img/dirs1.png)

Then you simply add `moleculeSchemas := Seq("app")` as we saw above.

### Multiple schemas

In the main Molecule project's examples module we have several Schema definition files:

![](/img/dirs2.png)

And we then list the paths to those like this in our `build.sbt`:

```scala
moleculeSchemas := Seq(
  "molecule/examples/dayOfDatomic",
  "molecule/examples/graph",
  "molecule/examples/mbrainz",
  "molecule/examples/seattle"
)
```

## 3. Compile

Now that you have created a schema definition file and told sbt about where to find it, you can compile 
your project from the terminal

```
> cd yourProjectRoot
> sbt compile
```

The MoleculePlugin will now automatically as part of the compilation process do 5 things:

1. Generate Molecule boilerplate dsl source code files (in the `src_managed` directory in target)
2. Generate a schema file with the necessary code to transact the Datomic schema  
3. Compile the generated code
4. Package both the source code and compiled classes into two `jar`s and place them in the `lib` directory of your module
5. Remove the generated source code and compiled classes

The MoleculePlugin create the `jars` so that you can use the boilerplate code without having to recompile any 
generated boilerplate code each time you recompile your project. In our demo example two jars are created:

![](/img/dirs3.png)


## 4. Use Molecule

The MoleculePlugin has now created all the necessary boilerplate code so that we can start using Molecule. 
We need to import our newly created meta DSL and the Molecule api. Molecule uses implicit macro methods to
transform our custom molecules to Datomic queries and we want to have as few of those in scope in order
to compile as fast as possible. So we therefore try to import only the implicits we need. If you for
instance are building molecules with maximum 10 attributes, you can therefore import the `out10` ("out"
for outputs):
```scala
import app.dsl.yourDomain._
import molecule.api.out10._ // (or other arity)
```
If you use input molecules awaiting an input then you can add `inX` where X is
how many [inputs](/manual/attributes/parameterized/) (1, 2 or 3) you will use, for instance:
```scala
import molecule.api.in2_out10._
```


## 5. Connect to database

To make queries we need an implicit database connection. When initially developing our project
we might make frequent changes to our schema and therefore recreate our database schema on each use. Later, when
our schema stabilizes we can retrieve the connection without recreating the database. The Molecule
sbt-plugin creates a Schema transaction file that we can use now to transact our schema - simply by applying it
to the `recreateDbFrom` method. 

We assign the returned Connection to an implicit variable to have it available for our molecules to 
access the connection implicitly.

```scala
implicit val conn = recreateDbFrom(app.schema.YourDomainSchema)

// Save data
Person.name("John").age(26).gender("male").save // implicitly uses `conn`

// Get data
val (person, age, gender) = Person.name.age.gender.get.head
```
