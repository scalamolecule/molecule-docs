# About

The Molecule project started in 2013 as a small library to access the [Datomic](http://datomic.com/) database from Scala in an intuitive way by letting macros transform Scala "molecules" to Datomic query strings.

Molecule is created by Marc Grue, a Danish double bass player in the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, the National Orchestra of Sweden. Marc is a passionate long-time Scala programmer (since version 2.7).

Molecule has since mature substantially to for instance have a unified API against all three [Datomic](http//datomic.com) systems: Peer, Peer Server and Cloud.

The [Changelog](http://localhost:1313/changelog/) shows the dedication to perfect the Molecule library.
