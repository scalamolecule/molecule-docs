# Molecule setup

Preparing to use Molecule involves 3 initial steps:

- [Define your Data Model](/setup/data-model),
- [Setup your project with sbt](/setup/setup-sbt)
- [Create database](/setup/create-db)

On the next pages we'll walk through those steps. 


## Quick-start Molecule demo

The fastest way to try out molecule is to clone the [molecule-demo](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-demo) Github repository

```
git clone https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-demo.git
```

Open in your IDE and play around making more molecules...
