# Molecule setup

Using Molecule involves 3 initial steps:

1. [Define your Data Model](/setup/data-model),
2. [Setup your project with sbt](/setup/sbt-setup)
3. [Get a database connection](/setup/db-connection)

On the next pages we'll walk through those steps. 


## Quick-start Molecule demo

The fastest way to try out molecule is to clone the [molecule-demo](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-demo) Github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-demo.git
```

and then open in your IDE and play around making more molecules.
